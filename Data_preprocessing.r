#==============================================================================#
# Re-code all variables
#==============================================================================#
# Recode gender, race and hospital_mortality into nominal variables and aki_stage into ordinal variable
# Moreoever, since SVM and logistic regression are both very sensitive to the scale of the variables,
# So we need to normalize all continuous variables
# This part will be done in python
